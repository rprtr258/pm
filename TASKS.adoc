=== in-work

=== technical debt
* split pid,uptime into two columns
* make `executable + arguments` run options be available
* add error messages and loggings to all error places
* run daemon if not running before executing (almost) any command
* self autoupdate
* use grpc status codes for server response errors
* serialize/deserialize protobuffers into database
* manage ids ourself, leveraging minimal not used id for new proc
* run procs using `goroutine`/`syscall.ForkExec()`/`os.StartProcess`

=== features
* config file with process definitions
** run specific processes from config
* additional commands
** `version`
** `daemon restart`
* implement different list formats
** `table`
** `short list`
** `json`
** `go format template`
* gen name if not provided
* `pm start` recognizing cmd&args vs ids/names/tags of processes in pm list to run
* add "smart filtering"" to delete and stop cmds
* `-i/...` flag to confirm which procs will be stopped

=== bugfixes
* fix "reborn failed: daemon: Resource temporarily unavailable" on start when daemon is already running
* if `~home/logs` does not exist - create
* actually stop proc on server.Stop method
* delete cmd must also delete log files
