# PM (process manager)
## Installation
PM is available only for linux due to heavy usage of linux mechanisms. Go to the [releases](https://github.com/rprtr258/pm/releases/latest) page to download the latest binary.

```sh
# download binary
wget https://github.com/rprtr258/pm/releases/latest/download/pm_linux_amd64
# make binary executable
chmod +x pm_linux_amd64
# move binary to $PATH, here just local
mv pm_linux_amd64 pm
```

### Systemd service
To enable running processes on system startup:

```sh
# soft link /usr/bin/pm binary to whenever it is installed
sudo ln -s ~/go/bin/pm /usr/bin/pm
# install systemd service, copy/paste output of following command
pm startup
```

After these commands, processes with `startup: true` config option will be started on system startup.

## Configuration
[jsonnet](https://jsonnet.org/) configuration language is used. It is also fully compatible with plain JSON, so you can write JSON instead.

See [example configuration file](./config.jsonnet). Other examples can be found in [tests](./e2e/tests) directory.

## Usage
Most fresh usage descriptions can be seen using `pm <command> --help`.

### Run process
```sh
# run process using command
pm run go run main.go

# run processes from config file
pm run --config config.jsonnet
```

### List processes
```sh
pm list
```

### Start already added processes
```sh
pm start [ID/NAME/TAG]...
```

### Stop processes
```sh
pm stop [ID/NAME/TAG]...

# e.g. stop all added processes (all processes has tag `all` by default)
pm stop all
```

### Delete processes
When deleting process, they are first stopped, then removed from `pm`.

```sh
pm delete [ID/NAME/TAG]...

# e.g. delete all processes
pm delete all
```

## Development
### Architecture
`pm` consists of two parts:

- **cli client** - requests server, launches/stops shim processes
- **shim** - monitors and restarts processes, handle watches, signals and shutdowns

### PM directory structure
`pm` uses directory `$HOME/.pm` to store data by default. `PM_HOME` environment variable can be used to change this. Layout is following:

```sh
$HOME/.pm/
├──config.json # pm config file
├──db/ # database tables
│   └──<ID> # process info
└──logs/ # processes logs
    ├──<ID>.stdout # stdout of process with id ID
    └──<ID>.stderr # stderr of process with id ID
```

### Differences from pm2
- `pm` is just a single binary, not dependent on `nodejs` and bunch of `js` scripts
- [jsonnet](https://jsonnet.org/) configuration language, back compatible with `JSON` and allows to thoroughly configure processes, e.g. separate environments without requiring corresponding mechanism in `pm` (others configuration languages might be added in future such as `Procfile`, `HCL`, etc.)
- supports only `linux` now
- I can fix problems/add features as I need, independent of whether they work or not in `pm2` because I don't know `js`
- fast and convenient (I hope so)
- no specific integrations for `js`

### Release
On `master` branch:

```sh
git tag v1.2.3
git push --tags
goreleaser release --clean
```
